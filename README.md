# 4F13-GPs
GPflow port of the first assignment of 4F13

[Original](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/4f13/1920/cw/coursework1.pdf) due to Carl Rasmussen for the Cambridge Univerity Engineering Department fourth-year course [4F13 - Probabilistic Machine Learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/4f13/1718/).

This version takes some inspiration from Damon Wischik's [Python port](https://github.com/damonjw/probml) of the course for students in the computer science department.
